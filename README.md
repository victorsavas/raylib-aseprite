# raylib-aseprite
A small C library which allows the user to import and draw [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) pixel arts and animations with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

# Usage
Simply include cute_aseprite.h, aseprite.c and aseprite.h in your source files and include the aseprite.h header in the relevant files.

The [cute_aseprite.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers/blob/master/cute_aseprite.h) header file used to parse .ase and .aseprite files was provided by [Randy Gaul's cute_headers repository](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers/tree/master).
